#### MedWatch: Real-Time Medicine Shortage & Price Anomaly Detection
MedWatch is a smart, real-time monitoring platform designed to detect, predict, and prevent medicine shortages and price anomalies, ensuring equitable access to healthcare for everyone in India.

### üìç The Problem
Every year, millions in India face a silent crisis: the sudden unavailability of essential medicines like insulin, thyroid medication, and cardiac drugs. This information gap leads to:
## Public Panic: 
Patients and their families are forced into frantic, time-consuming searches.
## Price Gouging: 
Unethical sellers exploit the desperation, inflating prices by 30-50% or more.
## Black Markets: 
Dangerous, unregulated channels emerge for life-saving drugs.
## Reactive Governance: 
Health authorities often learn about a shortage only after it has become a widespread crisis, leaving them with limited options to respond effectively.

### ‚ú® Our Solution
MedWatch tackles this problem head-on by creating a transparent, data-driven ecosystem connecting patients, pharmacies, and health authorities. Our platform transforms scattered information into actionable intelligence.

By combining crowdsourced patient reports with verified pharmacy inventory data, our powerful Anomaly Detection Engine identifies potential shortages and price spikes before they escalate, providing an early warning system for the entire healthcare chain.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
MedWatch is built with a modern, scalable, and real-time technology stack.

Frontend: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database & Services: Appwrite (Authentication, Real-time Database)
Rule-Based System: For detecting clear violations (e.g., stock below threshold).
ML-Ready Architecture: Designed for time-series analysis and predictive forecasting.

### System Flow
Data Ingestion: Patients submit reports and pharmacies update inventory via the React frontend.
Data Persistence: All data is securely stored in the Appwrite real-time database.
Anomaly Detection: The Node.js backend engine continuously processes data from Appwrite, running it through the Rule Engine and ML models.
Alert Generation: When an anomaly is detected, a new document is created in the anomalies collection.
Data Visualization: The React frontend listens for real-time updates from Appwrite to update the map and dashboards for all users.
